Riverside Hospital Cardiovascular Diseases Study
Cardiovascular Disease Case Study: Data-Driven Prevention at Riverside Specialist Hospital
Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden among patients at Riverside Specialist Hospital in India. The goal was to leverage clinical and demographic data to identify high-risk subgroups, determine the main modifiable risk factors, and recommend targeted, evidence-based prevention campaigns to reduce the short-term CVD burden.

The analysis followed a structured data analysis process (ASK → PREPARE → PROCESS → ANALYZE → SHARE → ACT)

Tools and Technologies:
Data Preparation and Cleaning: Microsoft Excel 
Visual Exploration and Dashboard Creation: Tableau 
Source Data: Cardiovascular disease dataset downloaded from Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/code/jocelyndumlao/cardiovascular-health-analysis/input

Key Findings
Overall Prevalence and DemographicsOverall Prevalence:
The prevalence of heart disease in the study population is 58%
Gender Disparity: Males account for a significantly higher proportion of cases (44.70% of cases) compared to females (13.30% of the cases)

Age and Gender Trends:
Males: Disease rates were higher in the younger population
Females: Disease risk increased with age, with the 70+ group having the highest prevalence among females

Modifiable Risk Factors Among Diseased Patients
The analysis identified three critical modifiable factors that drive disease risk, indicating strong targets for intervention:

Risk Factor Prevalence Among Diseased Patients: Insights
Severe Hypertension is 96.55%, meaning nearly all diseased patients had severe hypertension
High Serum Cholesterol (>= 240 mg/dL) is 84.48% in those diseased 
Diabetes (High Fasting Blood Sugar >120$ mg/dL) is 41.38%, thus a significant percentage of those with heart disease are diabetic

Critical Comorbidity: Patients with severe hypertension were also highly likely to have high cholesterol
The most common chest pain type in patients with both conditions was typical angina, but they were also likely to experience non-anginal pain

Recommendations and Interventions based on the findings

The following interventions were recommended for implementation by Riverside Specialist Hospital:
Targeted Screening Focus on Males (especially younger) and Older Females. Prioritize screening for Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Fasting Glucose15.
Lifestyle/Behavioral: Promote low-sodium diets, weight management, and medication adherence for hypertension control
Implement programs for diabetes prevention, dietary education, and glycemic control17.
Education Campaigns to raise awareness about typical angina and non-anginal chest pain as warning signs
Use social media and community meetings to reach different age groups
Integrated Care combined management efforts for hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia20.
Establish robust patient follow-up systems and a multidisciplinary clinic

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) 
To measure the impact of the prevention campaigns, the hospital should track the following metrics:
Population Health: Prevalence of hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes in the screened population
Clinical Outcomes: Percentage of hypertensive patients with controlled BP (<target) and diabetic patients with controlled fasting glucose (<target
Hospital Events: Number of CVD-related admissions
Program Engagement: Number of participants in educational workshops and enrollment in lifestyle modification programs

Data Limitations
Several limitations were acknowledged during the analysis, which should be addressed in future studies:
No Defined Collection Period: Difficult to assess current versus historical trends
Lack of Lifestyle Data: Key risk factors like smoking, diet, and physical activity were not included, limiting the assessment of the full range of modifiable contributors
No Comorbidity Data: Information on coexisting conditions (e.g., diabetes duration, obesity) was absent, limiting the ability to adjust for their influence on CVD risk
Cross-sectional Data: The data represent a single snapshot, meaning only associations, not causal relationships or disease progression over time, could be determined.
